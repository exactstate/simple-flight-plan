# How to use

Visit https://fly.weirdjet.com and upload your SimBrief XML flight plan.

## What it does

It basically shows you the most important information you will need during flight.

- Origin airport runway
- Destination airport runway
- Route
  - Waypoint name
  - Altitude
  - Stage (climb, cruise, decent)
  - Speed
- Fuel required and broken down (taxi, enroute burn, alternate burn etc)
- A crude map of each waypoint. Incomplete, but should give you a decent idea of where you are at each waypoint.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a pilot. Never been in a cockpit. Just a flight sim enthusiast. Some of the data represented might make no sense. This app helps me create a flight plan in the Working Title Citation CJ4 and I'm quite happy with its functionality.
